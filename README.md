#### Description:
Workout Planner is a website designed to be able to keep track of your workout rountines and give insight on your nutrition and exercises you can add to your workouts.

The first few pages including the registration, homepage, log in, and about us pages all use the layout1.html. This layout is used to create the navigation bar at the top which holds the links to these homepage, log in, and about us pages. You can click on any of these links to redirect you to each respective page. 

In the first screen which is the homepage, there is a video background that I added and a little motivational line in the center of the screen along with a "Get Started" button. This button can be then used to redirect you to the register screen. If you are already register you can click the "Log In" section of the navbar to directly go to the log in page, or if you want a brief description of the website, click the "About Us" part of the navbar. 

The about us page is a page that as the title suggests, gives information about the website. It welcomes you, and informs you that this workout planner can help plan your workouts, track your progress, and optimize nutrition. As well as a contact us part on the bottem which used the Harvard contact info.

After going to the register screen, there is a form where you can input your username, password, and confirm password, and the final register button. All of which need to be filled out in order to continue. This layout was inspired by other registration and log in forms I've seen. After clicking the register button you should be directed towards the registered screen. Do note that usernames are unique, where each unique username can be used for only one account. 

The registered screens should confirm that your account was created succesfully. Then there should appear a button that can redirect you to the log in screen to log into your account.

The log in page is similar in design to the registration page. It uses the same format with places to input your username and password. It will check the database and make sure your info is correct and matches, otherwise it will produce an error. There is also a link to if you haven't created your account you can sign up too. After inputting the correct information you should be able to click your log in button to get to the main dashboard page.

The rest of the website uses layout2.html, which changes the navigation bar to now have an exercise list, your routines, nutrition calculator, and a log out button. 

The first page of the dashboard just shows a cat meme which hopefully should motivate you to work out. 

Then you can go to the exercises tab which shows you popular exercises for each muscle group. This page uses a scrollable bar to look at all the provided exercises. For example, for the chest it reccommends you do bench press, incline dumbell press, and machine pec fly. This continues for the rest of the muscle groups which include chest, back, bicep, tricep, shoulders, and legs.

The routines tab will let you see your past saved routines and will have button that reads "New Routine" which will redirect you to the new routine page. This page will allow you to create new routines and save them based on the info.

Going to the new routines tab will have places to input the name of the routine, places to put the exercises with the sets, reps, and weight, and a optional notes tab to place any extra notes you will need for future workouts. After you are done filling this out, click the save routine button and it should place the routine in the routine tab for future reference.

If you click on one of the saved routines it will lead you to the routine details page. This pages will have the date it was created, the name, all the exercises you did and the optional notes if you did provide any. If you no longer want a routine, click the delete button to delete the routine from your accountl. These routines will save for the next visit.

Lastly there is the nutrition calculator which calculates your macros for you. If you input your age, height, weight, gender, and activity level, it can recommened you the minimum calories to maintain your weight along with the recommened carbs, proteins, and fats you should eat as well.

If you want to log out, simply press the log out button and it should direct you to the homepage.

This is the end of my project, thank you for reading and thank you CS50.
